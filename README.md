<br>

## ‚ú® Features

- **Highly Customizable:** Control every detail, from colors and fonts to the appearance of days and selector icons.
- **Multiple Selection Modes:** Support for single, multiple, and range date selection.
- **Easy Integration:** Add it to your project with just a few lines of code and start using it right away.
- **Performance-Focused:** Optimized for smooth performance even with large date ranges, thanks to its `RecyclerView`-based structure.
- **BottomSheet Support:** Designed for use within a modal `BottomSheet`.

## üì• Installation

1.  Ensure you have `mavenCentral()` in your root `settings.gradle.kts` file. (It's included by default in new projects.)

    ```kotlin
    // settings.gradle.kts
    dependencyResolutionManagement {
        repositories {
            google()
            mavenCentral()
        }
    }
    ```

2.  Add the following dependency to your module's `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```kotlin
    // build.gradle.kts
    dependencies {
        // Please replace '[LATEST-VERSION]' with the latest version number
        implementation("io.github.zapplications:calendarview:[LATEST-VERSION]")
    }
    ```

## üöÄ Basic Usage

You can use with bottom sheet in single selection mode:

```kotlin
// MainActivity.kt
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

    val calendarSheet = MonthlyCalendarBuilder.single() // this can be range() or multiple().
        .setCalendarViewConfig(
            CalendarViewConfig(
                disabledTextColor = com.zapplications.calendarview.R.color.color_disabled_text_red,
                showQuickSelectionBar = false
            )
        )
        .maxDate(LocalDate(2025, 10, 10))
        .build()
    button.setOnClickListener {
        calendarSheet.show(supportFragmentManager, "MonthlyCalendarSheet")
    }
}
```

## üé® Customization

`ZCalendar` can be easily customized via [CalendarViewConfig](https://github.com/iamsuatzengin/zcalendar/blob/main/calendarview/src/main/java/com/zapplications/calendarview/config/CalendarViewConfig.kt).

```kotlin
/**
 * Configuration class for customizing the appearance and behavior of the CalendarView.
 *
 * @property showQuickSelectionBar Whether the quick selection bar should be visible.
 * @property selectedTextColor The color resource ID for the text of a selected day.
 * @property unselectedTextColor The color resource ID for the text of an unselected day.
 * @property disabledTextColor The color resource ID for the text of a disabled day.
 * @property selectedBackgroundColor The color resource ID for the background of a selected day.
 * @property quickSelectionBarBackgroundColor The color resource ID for the background of the quick selection bar.
 * @property quickSelectionBarTextColor The color resource ID for the text of the quick selection bar.
 */
data class CalendarViewConfig(
    val showQuickSelectionBar: Boolean = false,

    @get:ColorRes
    val selectedTextColor: Int = R.color.color_day_selected,

    @get:ColorRes
    val unselectedTextColor: Int = R.color.color_day_grid_item,

    @get:ColorRes
    val disabledTextColor: Int = R.color.color_day_grid_item_disabled,

    @get:ColorRes
    val selectedBackgroundColor: Int = R.color.color_day_selected_bg,

    @get:ColorRes
    val quickSelectionBarBackgroundColor: Int = R.color.color_calendar_quick_selection_bar_bg,

    @get:ColorRes
    val quickSelectionBarTextColor: Int = R.color.color_day_grid_item,
)

```
